Great question — choosing between **joins** and **relationships** in Tableau can have a big impact on your analysis. Here's a clear breakdown to help you decide:

---

### 🧠 **Core Difference**

* **Joins**: Combine data **physically** at the row level **before analysis**.
* **Relationships**: Combine data **logically** at the time of **visualization**, keeping data sources more **modular and performant**.

---

### ✅ Use **Relationships** (Preferred in most modern use cases — Tableau 2020.2+)

Choose **relationships** when:

* You want Tableau to preserve each table’s **level of detail (LOD)**.
* Your tables are **at different granularities** (e.g., one table is by customer, another is by region or transaction).
* You want to avoid **data duplication** or **row inflation**.
* You plan to use **LOD expressions**, **row-level security**, or **complex filters**.

🟢 **Example**: You have one table with Customer Info and another with Orders. Using a relationship avoids duplicating customer data when a customer has multiple orders.

### ✅ Use **Joins**

Choose **joins** when:

* Both tables are **at the same level of detail**.
* You need to **blend fields directly** for row-by-row calculations (e.g., you need to divide `Sales` from one table by `Quota` from another).
* You want to create a **calculated field** using columns from both tables **before any visualization**.

🚨 **Caution**: Joins can introduce **nulls** or **duplicate rows**, especially with 1-to-many or many-to-many relationships.

🟢 **Example**: You have a table with Sales and another with Targets, both at the product level. You can use an **inner join on Product ID** to combine them and calculate performance.

### 📌 TL;DR Decision Guide

| Situation                                           | Use Relationships | Use Joins |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Different levels of detail?                         | ✅ Yes             | 🚫 No     |
| Need to preserve table integrity?                   | ✅ Yes             | 🚫 No     |
| Want Tableau to manage context at viz time?         | ✅ Yes             | 🚫 No     |
| Need to create row-level calculated fields pre-viz? | 🚫 No             | ✅ Yes     |
| Tables are at the same granularity                  | 🚫 No             | ✅ Yes     |
| Worried about duplicate rows/nulls?                 | ✅ Safer           | 🚫 Risky  |
