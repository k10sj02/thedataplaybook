# üèÜ Ultimate SQL Interview Cheat Sheet

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Running Totals & Cumulative Sums

‚úÖ **Key Function:** `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY column)`  
‚úÖ **Use Case:** Running totals of revenue, sales, or cumulative counts.  
üìå **Example:** Compute cumulative revenue over time.

```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount, 
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total 
FROM orders;



‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Moving Averages (Rolling Window Aggregates)

‚úÖ Key Function: AVG() OVER (ORDER BY column ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
üìå Example: Compute 7-day rolling average of revenue.

SELECT order_date, total_amount, 
       AVG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg 
FROM orders;



‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Handling NULLs

‚úÖ Key Functions:
	‚Ä¢	COALESCE(column, default_value) ‚Üí Replace NULL with a default value
	‚Ä¢	NULLIF(value1, value2) ‚Üí Returns NULL if both values are equal
	‚Ä¢	IS NULL / IS NOT NULL ‚Üí Filter NULL values

üìå Example: Replace missing values with 0.

SELECT customer_id, COALESCE(total_amount, 0) AS total_amount FROM orders;

üìå Example: Handle division by zero using NULLIF.

SELECT revenue / NULLIF(orders, 0) FROM sales;



‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Date & Time Manipulation

‚úÖ Key Functions:
	‚Ä¢	DATE_TRUNC() ‚Üí Truncate date to year, month, day, etc.
	‚Ä¢	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) ‚Üí Get year, month, or day from a date
	‚Ä¢	DATEADD(interval, value, date) ‚Üí Add/subtract days/months
	‚Ä¢	DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) ‚Üí Difference between dates

üìå Example: Find total sales per month.

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(total_amount) 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY month;

üìå Example: Find orders placed in the last 7 days.

SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';



‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ CTEs (Common Table Expressions) & Subqueries

‚úÖ CTEs (WITH cte AS (...)) ‚Üí Make queries more readable
‚úÖ Subqueries ‚Üí Nested queries within SELECT, FROM, or WHERE

üìå Example: Compute top customers by revenue using a CTE.

WITH customer_revenue AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue 
    FROM orders 
    GROUP BY customer_id
) 
SELECT * FROM customer_revenue 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC 
LIMIT 10;

üìå Example: Find customers who spent more than the average order amount using a subquery.

SELECT customer_id, total_amount 
FROM orders 
WHERE total_amount > (SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM orders);



‚∏ª

6Ô∏è‚É£ Recursive CTEs (Hierarchical Data)

‚úÖ Key Function: Recursive WITH
‚úÖ Use Case: Hierarchical relationships (e.g., org charts, folder structures).

üìå Example: Find all employees reporting to a specific manager.

WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id, 1 AS depth 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL -- Start with the CEO
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, h.depth + 1 
    FROM employees e 
    JOIN employee_hierarchy h 
    ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
) 
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;



‚∏ª

7Ô∏è‚É£ Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full, Self Joins, Cross Joins)

‚úÖ Use Case: Combine data from multiple tables efficiently.

üìå Example: Find customer orders and their details.

SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date, orders.total_amount 
FROM customers 
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;



‚∏ª

8Ô∏è‚É£ EXISTS vs. IN vs. JOIN (Performance Considerations)

‚úÖ Key Functions:
	‚Ä¢	EXISTS ‚Üí Stops at first match (efficient for large datasets)
	‚Ä¢	IN ‚Üí Works well for small lists but slower for large datasets
	‚Ä¢	JOIN ‚Üí Preferred when retrieving related columns

üìå Example: Find customers who have placed at least one order.

SELECT name 
FROM customers 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
);



‚∏ª

9Ô∏è‚É£ GROUP BY vs. DISTINCT vs. Window Functions

Feature	GROUP BY	DISTINCT	Window Functions
Use Case	Aggregates	Removes duplicates	Ranking, cumulative sums
Performance	Medium	Fast	Can be slow with large data

üìå Example: Count unique customers per region.

SELECT region, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
FROM customers 
GROUP BY region;



‚∏ª

üîü Pivoting & Unpivoting Data (CASE WHEN & PIVOT)

‚úÖ Key Functions:
	‚Ä¢	CASE WHEN for manual pivoting
	‚Ä¢	PIVOT() (if supported)
	‚Ä¢	UNPIVOT() for reversing pivot tables

üìå Example: Pivot sales data by region.

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'North' THEN total_amount END) AS north_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'South' THEN total_amount END) AS south_sales 
FROM orders;



‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Web Scraping & Large-Scale Data Aggregation

‚úÖ Key Techniques:
	‚Ä¢	Extracting data from APIs (JSON functions in SQL)
	‚Ä¢	Combining web-scraped datasets using UNION
	‚Ä¢	Cleaning and normalizing extracted data

üìå Example: Aggregating data from multiple sources into a single table.

SELECT name, address FROM web_data_source1 
UNION 
SELECT name, address FROM web_data_source2;



‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization (Indexing, Query Execution Plans)

‚úÖ Key Concepts:
	‚Ä¢	Use indexes (CREATE INDEX) to speed up queries.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
	‚Ä¢	Optimize JOIN orders (use smaller tables first).
	‚Ä¢	Use LIMIT or TOP to improve efficiency in large queries.

üìå Example: Add an index to speed up searches.

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders (customer_id);
