From 2020 to 2021, I volunteered at the COVID Tracking Project, where our efforts significantly enhanced the accuracy of data collection in the USA. Inspired by Alex the Analyst, our contributions played a crucial role in creating transparent and globally accessible COVID-19 statistics. This project exemplifies the impact of our work in providing reliable data that powered public health decisions worldwide.
