# How to Merge Datasets using Google Sheets 

Absolutely — here’s a clean, article-ready note you can store or build on later:

### 🧩 Using `INDEX` + `MATCH` + `ROW` to Merge Datasets by Header in Google Sheets

When working with multiple datasets that share overlapping **column names** but may have **different structures or column orders**, merging them cleanly can be a challenge — especially if you're avoiding manual copy-pasting.

A powerful technique in Google Sheets is to use a combination of:

* `INDEX()` to retrieve values by row and column position
* `MATCH()` to dynamically find the correct column based on header name
* `ROW()` to auto-adjust the row number as you drag down

#### 🔍 The Formula

```excel
=INDEX(source_range, ROW() - offset, MATCH(this_header, source_headers, 0))
```

Example:

```excel
=INDEX(index_match_cleaned_iv_37_survey!$A$2:$AE, ROW() - 340, MATCH(A$1, index_match_cleaned_iv_37_survey!$A$1:$AE$1, 0))
```

### 🔨 How It Works

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `index_match_cleaned_iv_37_survey!$A$2:$AE`                  | The data you're pulling from — excludes header row                                                                       |
| `ROW() - 340`                                                | Adjusts the formula to start at the 1st row of the source data when you're working from row 341                          |
| `MATCH(A$1, index_match_cleaned_iv_37_survey!$A$1:$AE$1, 0)` | Looks up the position of the header in your current sheet (e.g., "First Name") and finds its column number in the source |

### ✅ Benefits

* **Header-based merging**: Columns don’t have to be in the same order.
* **No manual matching required**: As long as headers match, the data aligns.
* **Dynamic and scalable**: Works well with hundreds or thousands of rows.

### 🧠 Pro Tip

This approach is ideal when consolidating data from multiple forms or exports, like survey results or campaign outreach logs, where field names might be reused but in different column orders.

You can even **repeat the formula across several columns**, and as long as your top row contains the desired headers, the formula will grab the right column automatically from the source.

### 📚 Stacking Multiple Datasets After Header-Based Merge

Once you’ve used `INDEX` + `MATCH` to align columns by header, the next step in combining datasets is **vertical stacking** — essentially appending one dataset under another, ensuring the same column structure.

This is especially useful in scenarios like:

* Combining survey responses from different waves or tools
* Merging voter outreach data from different time periods or sources
* Unifying campaign canvassing logs with shared fields

---

### ✅ Goal

Create a **master sheet** that stacks multiple source sheets **by column name**, even if the original order varies.

---

### 🔁 Step-by-Step

#### 1. **Set up a consistent header row**

In your master sheet (e.g., `MergedData`), define the column headers manually. These should be the consistent field names used across your different datasets (e.g., `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Email`, etc.).

#### 2. **Use `INDEX` + `MATCH` + `ROW()` for each source block**

Suppose:

* `Dataset A` has 300 rows of data starting on row 2
* `Dataset B` has 200 rows, also starting on row 2
* You want to start `Dataset B` at row 302 in the master sheet

You'd write:

**For Dataset A:**

```excel
=INDEX(SheetA!$A$2:$Z, ROW() - 1, MATCH(A$1, SheetA!$A$1:$Z$1, 0))
```

**For Dataset B (starting at row 302):**

```excel
=INDEX(SheetB!$A$2:$Z, ROW() - 301, MATCH(A$1, SheetB!$A$1:$Z$1, 0))
```

> 🔍 `ROW() - 301` ensures the first row of `SheetB` data starts outputting at row 302 of the master sheet.

Repeat this across all columns by dragging or copying formulas.

### 🧠 Tips for Clean Stacking

* Ensure header names in each sheet exactly match the headers in your master sheet.
* Use conditional formatting to highlight misaligned or missing data.
* Consider freezing the top row and labeling each section (e.g., “Wave 1”, “Wave 2”) for traceability.
* Wrap each block in `IFERROR()` if you want blank cells instead of errors when rows run out:

  ```excel
  =IFERROR(INDEX(...), "")
  ```

### 🧰 Optional: Automate with Google Apps Script

If your datasets are very large or you want to make this process repeatable with a single click, consider using Google Apps Script to copy and merge sheets programmatically — especially useful for monthly or weekly reporting workflows.
