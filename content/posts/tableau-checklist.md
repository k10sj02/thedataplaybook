To become a **master of Tableau**, especially as a data analyst or analytics engineer, you'll want to go **deep** in both **technical features** and **analytical storytelling**. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the **core topics** and **advanced skills** you should know *back to front*:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Core Tableau Concepts**

Mastering the fundamentals is non-negotiable.

* âœ… Data connections (live vs extract)
* âœ… Data types and roles (dimension vs measure)
* âœ… Discrete vs continuous fields
* âœ… Aggregation types (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
* âœ… Show Me panel and basic chart types
* âœ… Drag-and-drop mechanics and shelves (Rows, Columns, Filters, Pages, Marks, Tooltip)

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2. Data Preparation in Tableau**

Data structure = visualization success.

* âœ… Joins, Unions, Blends
* âœ… Pivoting and reshaping data
* âœ… Data interpreter
* âœ… Relationships (new data model in Tableau)
* âœ… Working with multiple data sources

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Filters and Order of Operations**

Precision in filtering is key.

* âœ… Filter types (dimension, measure, relative date, wildcard, etc.)
* âœ… Context filters vs regular filters
* âœ… Tableau's order of operations (very important!)
* âœ… Filtering across data sources

---

### ðŸ”¸ **4. Calculated Fields and Logic**

Custom calculations = analytical power.

* âœ… String, date, and number functions
* âœ… IF, CASE, IIF, ZN, ISNULL logic
* âœ… LOD Expressions (FIXED, INCLUDE, EXCLUDE)
* âœ… Quick table calculations vs custom
* âœ… Nested calculations and parameters

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Visual Design and Best Practices**

You must be able to **tell clear stories** with your visuals.

* âœ… Dashboard layout and spacing
* âœ… Choosing the right chart type
* âœ… Color theory and accessibility
* âœ… Tooltips, annotations, highlight actions
* âœ… Interactive elements (filters, highlighters, sets)

---

### ðŸ”¸ **6. Table Calculations (Advanced)**

A major turning point in skill level.

* âœ… INDEX(), RANK(), WINDOW\_SUM(), LOOKUP(), etc.
* âœ… Understanding partitioning and addressing
* âœ… Using Compute Using
* âœ… Nested table calcs

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. Parameters and Interactivity**

Building dynamic, flexible dashboards.

* âœ… Creating and using parameters
* âœ… Parameter actions (for user-driven control)
* âœ… Swapping sheets
* âœ… Dynamic measures and dimensions
* âœ… Drill-downs and collapsible menus

---

### ðŸ”¸ **8. Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions**

Unlocking complex aggregations.

* âœ… FIXED vs INCLUDE vs EXCLUDE
* âœ… When to use LODs instead of table calcs
* âœ… LOD + filters (especially with context filters)
* âœ… LOD + parameters

---

### ðŸ”¹ **9. Dashboard Development**

From single views to full dashboards that tell a story.

* âœ… Designing with purpose: analytical, operational, strategic dashboards
* âœ… Layout containers (horizontal, vertical)
* âœ… Device layout and responsiveness
* âœ… Action filters, URL actions, navigation
* âœ… Performance optimization

---

### ðŸ”¸ **10. Performance and Optimization**

Especially important for large datasets.

* âœ… Extract vs live performance tradeoffs
* âœ… Performance recording and load times
* âœ… Reducing nested calculations
* âœ… Use of context filters
* âœ… Reducing mark count and data granularity

---

### ðŸ§  Bonus: **Soft Skills + Mastery Mindset**

Even technical mastery isnâ€™t enough without *applied excellence*:

* âœ… Storytelling with data (e.g., Cole Nussbaumer's work)
* âœ… Asking the right analytical questions
* âœ… Stakeholder communication
* âœ… Version control (Tableau Public, Tableau Server, or Git for workbook files)
* âœ… Building portfolio-worthy dashboards
