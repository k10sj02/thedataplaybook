# 🔧 25 Tableau Functions That Do 80% of the Work in Tableau

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by Tableau’s massive toolbox, you’re not alone. But here’s the truth: **you only need to master a core group of functions to get through the majority of real-world data analysis tasks.**

Based on the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule), these are the **Top 25 Tableau functions** that power 80%+ of practical dashboards and insights.

---

## 🔢 Core Aggregations & Math
- `SUM()` – The go-to aggregation for totals.
- `AVG()` – Useful for trend smoothing and performance metrics.
- `COUNT()` / `COUNTD()` – Count all vs. distinct values.
- `MIN()` / `MAX()` – Boundary values, helpful in filters and KPIs.
- `ZN()` – Converts nulls to zero to avoid gaps in charts.
- `ABS()` – Returns absolute values (e.g. for error bars or deviations).

---

## 📅 Date & Time Functions
- `DATEPART()` – Extracts parts of a date (year, month, etc.).
- `DATETRUNC()` – Rounds dates down to a specified unit (e.g. week).
- `NOW()` / `TODAY()` – Current time or date for dynamic calculations.
- `DATEDIFF()` – Time elapsed between two dates.
- `MAKEDATE()` / `MAKETIME()` – Construct custom date/time fields.
- `DATEADD()` – Add/subtract time units from a date (e.g. 30 days forward).

---

## 🔁 Conditional Logic & Filtering
- `IF / THEN / ELSEIF` – The most common logic block in Tableau.
- `CASE` – Neater than `IF` for handling many conditions.
- `IIF()` – A short-hand conditional function.
- `ISNULL()` / `IFNULL()` – Identifies or fills in missing values.
- `IN` – Check if a value is part of a list or set.
- `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` – Combine multiple logical conditions.

---

## 📊 Table Calculations
- `INDEX()` – Assign row numbers or enable sorting logic.
- `RANK()` / `RANK_DENSE()` – Rank items in a partitioned group.
- `WINDOW_SUM()` / `WINDOW_AVG()` – Aggregate values over a sliding window.
- `LOOKUP()` – Access another row’s value (e.g. previous period).
- `RUNNING_SUM()` – Create cumulative metrics or rolling totals.

---

## 🔠 String & Type Functions
- `STR()` / `INT()` / `FLOAT()` – Convert between data types.
- `CONTAINS()` / `LEFT()` / `RIGHT()` / `MID()` – Basic string parsing and matching.

### ✅ Final Thoughts

Master these 25 functions and you’ll be equipped to handle almost everything Tableau throws at you—from exploratory data analysis to polished dashboards.

Whether you're in nonprofit, finance, marketing, or climate advocacy, this list is your **Tableau survival kit**.
